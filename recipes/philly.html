    <p><strong><em>Straight From The Liberty Bell</em></strong></p>
    <p> A sandwich made from thinly sliced pieces of beefsteak and melted cheese in a long hoagie roll. A popular regional fast food, it has its roots in the U.S. city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh steak (rib-eye, round, or sirloin)</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, sliced thin</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce</li>
        <li>4 soft sandwich rolls</li>
        <li>1 (8 fl oz) jar cheese spread</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a large non-stick skillet. Saute onions and 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce until the onions are soft.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced meat and cook until meat browns slightly, add remaining 1 tablespoon of teriyaki sauce and stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Place cheese on the meat and stir until melted, mixing meat, onions and cheese together. Scoop meat mixture onto sandwich rolls.
