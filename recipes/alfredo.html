    <p><strong><em>A Glorious Pasta Dish From Italy</em></strong></p>
    <p> An Italian pasta dish consisting of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and parmesan cheese. 
        Fresh Parmesan cheese (none of that Kraft kind). As the cheese melts, it creates a smooth and rich coating of cheese sauce.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
        <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.</li>
        <li>Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.</li>
    </ol>
